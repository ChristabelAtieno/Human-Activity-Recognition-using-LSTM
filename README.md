# Human Activity Recognition using RNN-LSTM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on recognizing human activities based on wearable sensor data using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** models. The goal is to classify different physical activities (e.g., walking, sitting, lying, jogging) to help monitor physical wellness or support healthcare applications.

---

## Features
- **Time-series sensor data** from wearable devices.
- **RNN and LSTM models** for sequential data processing.
- Preprocessing steps include:
  - Data cleaning
  - Feature scaling
  - Dimensionality reduction (handling multicollinearity)
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

---

## Project Goal
- Build a robust deep learning model to classify human activities.
- Provide insights for **physical wellness monitoring**, early detection of abnormal patterns, or alerting in healthcare scenarios.
